# Contributing to the Torch Datasets Project

Hi everyone! 

I'm Shubh, and I've started this project to build a collection of PyTorch datasets that are easy to use and help simplify and speed up data loading for everyone.

As we haven’t released a version on PyPI yet, we're currently not accepting pull requests. However, if you’re interested in contributing, we’d love to hear your ideas! Feel free to share your suggestions in the [Discussions](#) or on the [Issues](#) page.

If we implement a dataset based on your idea, we’ll be sure to acknowledge you as a contributor — and we may even invite you to help implement it directly!

Thanks so much for your interest and support!
